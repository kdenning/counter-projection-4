# counter-projection-4

The "Data cleaning & exporting.R" file cleaned the original file titled "data_downloaded_January_20_2021.csv." It then exported a long-format file titled long_format.csv. This was done in a separate file to lessen the code in the main analysis document titled "counter-projection-4.Rmd." You do not need to run "Data cleaning & exporting.R" file, you can begin with "counter-projection-4.Rmd," as the long-format.csv has been uploaded to this repo.

Any code I wrote but didn't use or played around with was put into the "Extra code.Rmd" document. 

If you want to see all the questions used in the survey, you can check them out in the word document titled "Survey exported from Qualtrics."
